<p>Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Will be writting mostly about mobile apps and how they can assist to facilate commerce especially cross border trade.Having worked in the designing and implementation of cross-border trade facilation tools, I have learned that mobile apps can deliver the much needed services to these cross border traders as they spend most of their time on the go.</p>
<p>I will be building an android app that provides information on trade faciltating tools required at border posts as well as latest changes at these border posts.</p>  
<p> More updates on this in my next post.</p>
